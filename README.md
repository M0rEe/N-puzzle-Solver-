# N-puzzle-Solver-
Using Astar  & BFS  algorithms we havve made this solver 

in A* you can use Manhattan Distance OR Hamming Distance as a heuritsic function

 * *which is used to guide the algorithm to the best moves can be made in the current state 
  * *with optimized Manhattan Distance the A* algorithm runs faster but takes alot of memory depending on the colisons made in each state
  
in BFS as its an UN-informed search so, its discovering every child from current state which expected to be alot longer in time but smaller in space

you can refer to pseudocode for A* and BFS on Wikipedia
