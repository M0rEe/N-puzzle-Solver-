# N-puzzle-Solver-
Using Astar  & BFS  algorithms we ve made this solver 
in A* you can use Manhattan Distance OR Hamming Distance as a heuritsic function 
  which is used to guide the algorithm to the best  moves can be made in the current state 
  with optimized Manhattan Distance the A* algorithm runs faster but takes alot of memory depending on the colisons made in each state
in BFS as its UN-informed search so its discovering every child from current state which expected to be alot longer in time but smaller in space 


you can refer to pseudocode for A* and BFS on Wikipedia

this is gif explaning how the algorithm works for solving input puzzle
